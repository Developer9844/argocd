<p>In order to speed up recoveries in case of pod failures, you can leverage Flinkâ€™s working directory feature <br>
together with local recovery. If the working directory is configured to reside on a persistent volume that gets <br>
remounted to a restarted TaskManager pod, then Flink is able to recover state locally. With the StatefulSet, <br>
Kubernetes gives you the exact tool you need to map a pod to a persistent volume.

Deploying TaskManagers as a StatefulSet, allows you to configure a volume <br>
claim template that is used to mount persistent volumes to the TaskManagers. Additionally, you need <br>
to configure a deterministic taskmanager.resource-id. A suitable value is the pod name, that you expose using <br>
environment variables. For an example StatefulSet configuration take a look at the appendix.</p>
