<p>In order to speed up recoveries in case of pod failures, you can leverage Flinkâ€™s working directory feature <br>
together with local recovery. If the working directory is configured to reside on a persistent volume that gets <br>
remounted to a restarted TaskManager pod, then Flink is able to recover state locally. With the StatefulSet, <br>
Kubernetes gives you the exact tool you need to map a pod to a persistent volume.
